        <h3>A quick primer about runtime extensions (rEx)</h3>
        <p>Runtime extensions are the end-user's ability to add new commands (extensions) to iab while it's running (runtime).<br/>
        There are a couple things to note:
        <ul>
        <li>You can only create up to four runtime extensions unless you become a plus user (see iab!plus)</li>
        <li>Runtime extensions can only contain text (which can include an image link, but you cannot use it to upload a file.)</li>
        <li>Runtime extensions cannot be created with the same name as an internal command (which may be changed at some point.)</li>
        <li>You must be in the same server as the user who created a runtime command to use it.</li>
        <li>You cannot create a runtime command with the same name as any other command. It is planned to develop a new command syntax for running runtime extensions that uses a username so that duplicate names can be allowed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Runtime extensions can be run with the prefix <span class="iabCommandSyntax"> rex! </span>(<span class="iabCommandSyntax">rexd</span> if using iabd)</p>
        <p>Also I'm disclaiming responsibility for runtime extensions. If someone does something mean with it, it's not my fault.</p>
