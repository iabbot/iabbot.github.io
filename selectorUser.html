<h1 class="iabCommand">iab! Selector Reference: %</h1>
<p> % refers to a user to be targeted. A target can either be Nickname, Username, Username#Discriminator, mention, or id.
<p> For example, take a user named User#5912, with the id 102 (which is not a full length id, but who the hell cares amirite), and the mention <@user>. This user has the nickname Boi.</p>
<p> Valid ways to target this user are as follows </p>
<ul>
<li>User</li>
<li>User#5912</li>
<li>102</li>
<li>Boi</li>
</ul>
<p> Invalid ways to target this user are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>user (the name must match exactly. See below for capitalization sensitivity) </li>
<li>boi (same reason as above)</li>
<li>5912 (I mean come on, the discriminator alone isn't anything to go by.</li>
</ul>
<div class="reasoning">
<p>Targeting is capitalization sensitive primarily because the function outright fails if someone has unicode characters in their name. For example, my username as of writing is うん#6878. If .ToLower() was called on "うん#6878", it would throw an exception and fail. Furthermore, it's not really that helpful; if you had a user named Ryan 。ｗ　。#0000, it would probably fail there, too. It's just not really that helpful to have such a feature when it's pretty likely to fail anyways. Even then, it's easier just to slam an @ before it and call it a day. If you don't want them to know you're targeting them (for that sweet avatar theivery), just use Developer Mode and copy their id.</p>
