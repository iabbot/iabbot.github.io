            <h1 class="lightcolor tc"> What is the cII Module? </h1>
            <p>In the near future binding actions to Discord accounts will become cumbersome and difficult with the things I want to expand iab to do. To alleviate this, I've created the cII system. cII is actually a connection to the group of programs that form the II Interface. I'm purposely not defining II because I think the name is kind of shit and I want time to be able to rename it. Suffice it to say that AkaiCuda (AKAIP, AKAIPPI, etc.) is part of the II Interface. Creating an account allows me to handle saving information more intelligently. That and PGSql numeric are such a pain in the ass to work with.</p>
			<p>People may be (understandably) worried about the safety of their email accounts. Rest assured I don't want the money from selling your email accounts. They're encrypted, the usual shit, really.</p>
			<p>Having a cII account (or really using iab in general) allows me to collect information about what you do with it. Go to <a href="cIIPP.html">The cII Privacy Policy</a> if you're interested in what I collect. None of this information is sold or shared (not that it's that interesting in the first place.</p>
            <h2 class="lightcolor">Why would I want that?</h2>
			<p>Certain features of iab will eventually be locked behind a cII account. As of current, though, the maximum upload limit for a verified cII user is 2 times as large.</p>
			<h2 class="lightcolor">How can I get a cII account?</h2>
			<p>To sign up for the cII module, you need to perform a few commands in direct messages to iab. <strong style="color:#FF7777"> iab will NOT handle these commands outside of a direct message channel.</strong></p>
			<p>1. Perform cii!register -username (your desired username) -password (your desired password) -email (your desired email). <br/> For example, cii!register -username iab -password iab -email iab@iab.iab
			After a few seconds (provided something doesn't break), you should get an email from <strong style="color:#FF7777"> ciiiabmailserver@gmail.com</strong> containing your verification code (which should be in the cII-(number) format)</p>
			<p>2. Run cii!verify -email (your email) -code (the code, in its entirety). It should say that your account was verified.</p>
			<p>3. Run cii!binddiscord -username (your username) -password (your password). Then you're fully signed up and set for cII.</p>
