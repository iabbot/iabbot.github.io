            <h1 class="lightcolor"> How does iab calculate image size when it checks limits? </h1>
            <p>When iab checks to see how large an image is, it is often disparate from the actual image's file size. 
            This is because iab first decompresses the image into an ARGB Bitmap, which uses four bytes per pixel. 
            The limits are set to account for this; Regular users should be able to upload a 2048x2048 image without worries. 
            Likewise, +1 and +2 users should be able to upload 4096x4096 and 8192x8192 images respectively. </p>
            <p>The images do not need to be square. To remain within the limit, the images should simply have equal to or less than the amount of pixels of a 2048x2048 image. 
            For example, a 4096x1024 image would still be within the limit of a regular user.</p>
