<p> $ refers to a role to be targeted. A target can either be the exact name of the role, its position (with @everyone being 0 (although most commands do not allow @everyone to be selected)), its mention, or its id.
<p> As an example, let's take a role named Members, with the position of 1 (second lowest role) and an id of 1291.</p>
<p> Valid ways to target this role are as follows </p>
<ul>
<li>Members</li>
<li>@Members</li>
<li>1</li>
<li>1291</li>
</ul>
<p> Invalid ways to target this user are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>members (the name must match exactly.) </li>
</ul>
